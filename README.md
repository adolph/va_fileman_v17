Documentation for VA Fileman Version 17

If you found this repo because you need it, I wish you luck. I had a hard time find this documentation a few years back. It was tucked in the back corner of some site as a zoo archive. Also you may want to know that Intersystems Cache is a MUMPS implementation with a DEC DSM compatibility mode that allows makes porting old applications much easier/possible. There are two parts to the documentation:
* Program: Intended for people who would write data access programs, basically an API reference
* User: Intended for people who use Fileman utilities to create, read, update, and delete records

If you are interested in learning more about VA Fileman, I suggest that you go ahead and use version 22 which is well documented by [hardhats.org](http://www.hardhats.org/).
